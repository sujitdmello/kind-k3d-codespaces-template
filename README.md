# Kubernetes Dev Cluster on Codespaces Template

> Setup a Kubernetes Developer Cluster using `kind` or `k3d` running in [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

> [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) is currently in `limited public beta`

## Overview

This is a template that will setup a Kubernetes developer cluster using `Kind` or `K3d` in a `GitHub Codespace` or local `Dev Container`

We use this for `inner-loop` Kubernetes development. Note that it is not appropriate for production use (but is a great `Developer Experience`)

> This Codespace is tested with `zsh` and `oh-my-zsh` - it "should" work with bash ...

## Create your repo

Create your repo from this template and add your application code

- Click the `Use this template` button
- Enter your repo details

## Open with Codespaces

- Click the `Code` button on your repo
- Click `Open with Codespaces`
- Click `New Codespace`
- Choose the `4 core` or `8 core` option

## Open Workspace

- When prompted, choose `Open Workspace`

## Build and Deploy Cluster

By default the solution will create a `kind` cluster. If you want to use [k3d](https://k3d.io/), run the make commands from the `k3d` directory

  ```bash

  # (optional) use the k3d makefile
  cd k3d

  # build the cluster
  make all

  ```

## Validate Deployment

Output from `make all` should resemble this

```text

default      fluentb                                   1/1   Running   0   31s
default      jumpbox                                   1/1   Running   0   25s
default      webv                                      1/1   Running   0   31s
default      ngsa-memory                               1/1   Running   0   33s
monitoring   grafana-64f7dbcf96-cfmtd                  1/1   Running   0   32s
monitoring   prometheus-deployment-67cbf97f84-tjxm7    1/1   Running   0   32s

```

## Service endpoints

- All endpoints are usable in your browser via clicking on the `Ports (4)` tab
  - Select the `open in browser icon` on the far right
- Some popup blockers block the new browser tab
- If you get a gateway error, just hit refresh - it will clear once the port-forward is ready

```bash

# check endpoints
make check

```

## Validate deployment with k9s

- From the Codespace terminal window, start `k9s`
  - Type `k9s` and press enter
  - Press `0` to select all namespaces
  - Wait for all pods to be in the `Running` state (look for the `STATUS` column)
  - Use the arrow key to select `nsga-memory` then press the `l` key to view logs from the pod
  - To go back, press the `esc` key
  - To view other deployed resources - press `shift + :` followed by the deployment type (e.g. `secret`, `services`, `deployment`, etc).
  - To exit - `:q <enter>`

### Other interesting endpoints

Open [curl.http](./curl.http)

> [curl.http](./curl.http) is used in conjuction with the Visual Studio Code [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) extension.
>
> When you open [curl.http](./curl.http), you should see a clickable `Send Request` text above each of the URLs

![REST Client example](./images/RESTClient.png)

Clicking on `Send Request` should open a new panel in Visual Studio Code with the response from that request like so:

![REST Client example response](./images/RESTClientResponse.png)

## Jump Box

A `jump box` pod is created so that you can execute commands `in the cluster`

- use the `kj` alias
  - `kubectl exec -it jumpbox -- bash -l`
    - note: -l causes a login and processes `.profile`
    - note: `sh -l` will work, but the results will not be displayed in the terminal due to a bug

- use the `kje` alias
  - `kubectl exec -it jumpbox --`
- example
  - run http against the ClusterIP
    - `kje http ngsa-memory:8080/version`

## View Prometheus Dashboard

- Click on the `ports` tab of the terminal window
- Click on the `open in browser icon` on the Prometheus port (30000)
- This will open Prometheus in a new browser tab

- From the Prometheus tab
  - Begin typing NgsaAppDuration_bucket in the `Expression` search
  - Click `Execute`
  - This will display the `histogram` that Grafana uses for the charts

## Launch Grafana Dashboard

- Grafana login info
  - admin
  - akdc-512

- Once `make all` completes successfully
  - Click on the `ports` tab of the terminal window
  - Click on the `open in browser icon` on the Grafana port (32000)
  - This will open Grafana in a new browser tab

![Codespace Ports](./images/CodespacePorts.jpg)

## View Grafana Dashboard

- Click on `Home` at the top of the page
- From the dashboards page, click on `NGSA`

![Grafana](./images/Grafana.jpg)

## Run a load test

```bash

# from Codespaces terminal

# run a baseline test (will generate warnings in Grafana)
make test

# run a 60 second load test
make load-test

```

- Switch to the Grafana brower tab
- The test will generate 400 / 404 results
- The requests metric will go from green to yellow to red as load increases
  - It may skip yellow
- As the test completes
  - The metric will go back to green (1.0)
  - The request graph will return to normal

## View Fluent Bit Logs

- Start `k9s` from the Codespace terminal
- Select `fluentb` and press `enter`
- Press `enter` again to see the logs
- Press `s` to Toggle AutoScroll
- Press `w` to Toggle Wrap
- Review logs that will be sent to Log Analytics when configured

## Build and deploy a local version of WebValidate

- Switch back to your Codespaces tab

```bash

# from Codespaces terminal

# make and deploy a local version of WebV to k8s
make webv

```

## Build and deploy a local version of ngsa-memory

- Switch back to your Codespaces tab

```bash

# from Codespaces terminal

# make and deploy a local version of ngsa-memory to k8s
make app

```

> [Makefile](./Makefile) is a good place to start exploring

## FAQ

- Why don't we use helm to deploy Kubernetes manifests?
  - The target audience for this repository is app developers who are beginning their Kubernetes journey so we chose simplicity for the Developer Experience.
  - In our daily work, we use Helm for deployments and it is installed in the `.devcontainer` should you want to use it.
